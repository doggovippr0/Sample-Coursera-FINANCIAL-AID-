Ở đây, chúng mình cần trả lời tổng cộng 3 câu hỏi từ Coursera:

*Câu 1: Why are you applying for Financial Aid?*
` I found out about Coursera through my friends, and through research and trial lessons, I enjoyed the courses here. I need the knowledge that Coursera provides but I am currently in financial difficulty and cannot afford this course. I am a student at HCM University of Science in Vietnam. My family is a farmer, so my income is quite low, paying for my school fees has been very difficult for my family, and I don't want to burden them anymore. Moreover, now that Vietnam is having a very serious covid-19 epidemic, my family's income has dropped heavily, the economic problem is even more difficult. We do not have any subsidies. This is why I applied for financial aid on Coursera. I hope I will learn more when I finish the course and I can share much of the knowledge that Coursera has to offer to more people who need it. `
*Câu 2: How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?*
`I am a student at HCM University of Science in Vietnam, majoring in economics. And now I am learning and want to improve my knowledge about the data analysis industry. After researching, I found this google course on Coursera is good. I have taken 2 courses in the google course series before and I have learned a lot of useful knowledge and therefore I believe this course is very relevant and important for me. With this course you will learn more knowledge about SQL, data collection, spreadsheet,... All of them are very important skills of data analysis. Completing this course also gave me more confidence in my data analysis skills, as well as a solid footing in the data analytics field that I love so much.

I hope with Coursera's financial support, I will learn more good knowledge and achieve my goal of becoming a real data analyst.

During my studies, I will commit to study fully, on schedule, and meet deadlines as well as fully comply with the policies set out by Coursera. `
*Câu 3: Would you consider using a low-interest loan to pay for your courses?*
Các bạn nhớ tick vào NO ở ô chọn YES OR NO này, tức là bạn không chấp nhận khoảng vay tro khóa học.
` I don’t have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now. An additional amount of interest expense and stress of bearing debt is really a matter to me right now.

Covid-19 makes it’s really difficult to a low-income person like me to make a living. `
Có thể thay Covid-19 bằng bất cứ lý do gì khiến bạn nghèo.
